Added readme with `usethis::use_readme_rmd()`. Need to mannually knit to md if 
you want a README on GitHub that is rendered nicely.

For internal functions that you document, you should put the
`#' @keywords internal` so the documentation is not in the package index. Index
is the page that you reach when you are on a help file and then scroll to the 
very bottom and click on *Index*.
